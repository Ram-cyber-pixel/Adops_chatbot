When we reached out to the CSM, the CSM replied to use the same traffic and informed the Agency that there is a slight mismatch in the titles provided with the available.\n\nWhen 70% of the title matches, it is okay to proceed. However, if the main keywords are mismatching with the Traffic, it is always best to inform the CSM about this."

However, in this ticket, the CSM mentioned that it is okay to use the general traffic for the 6500 syscode as per the previous confirmations from the Agency.\n\nIf there is no note from the CSM allowing the use of general traffic for the 6500 syscode, we can follow the previous method we usually adhere to. Additionally, when checking the missing orders for other syscodes, if there is no NA & PJ zones traffic, the 6500 syscode orders can be ignored. Since we are still receiving the NJ & PA zones traffic, this applies to this case as well\n\n\Ticket Details for BETMGM\n\n**Ticket#1946249**\n\n**Scenario:**\n- Previously, for the client **BETMGM**, special instructions were received for **6500 syscode**.\n- Moving forward, we can proceed with **general instructions**, as **BETMGM is no longer a VIP client**.\n\n**Confirmation:**\n- This update has been confirmed in **Ticket#1946134**.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Follow general instructions for handling BETMGM tickets and disregard any prior requirements for special instructions on the 6500 syscode."

In response, we were informed to apply only the special programming spots for the Hiatus weeks/dates, adhering to the network limits and zone limitations.\n\nAfter multiple interactions, the agency provided new traffic with updated limitations, including Zones and Time limitations.
